ZeroPool smart contract for Near
================================

Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] â‰¥ 12
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Deploy the contract: `yarn deploy` (see `package.json` for a
   full list of `scripts` you can run with `yarn`)

Work with the contract
======================
To interact with the contract, you can use the following methods:
1. Call `lock` a certain amount (the `approve` method in `zeropoop-support-js`). This is a primitive lockup function used to simulate the approve system in Ethereum.
2. Prepare data for a new private transaction on the client (`zeropoop-client-js` can be used to prepare and send the transaction to the relayer).
3. The relayer then can serialize the transaction and send it to the contract (`transact`).

Deploy
======

Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    yarn install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `zeropool.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `zeropool.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account zeropool.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet


Step 2: set contract name in code
---------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'near-blank-project.YOUR-NAME.testnet'


Step 3: deploy!
---------------

builds & deploys smart contract to NEAR TestNet:

    yarn deploy



Troubleshooting
===============

On Windows, if you're seeing an error containing `EPERM` it may be related to spaces in your path. Please see [this issue](https://github.com/zkat/npx/issues/209) for more details.
